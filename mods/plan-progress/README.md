# Claude Code mods

## plan-progress

Live progress bars above the Claude Code prompt. Claude breaks medium and large tasks into stages and steps, and you watch them fill in real time, with the subagents working on each task right under its bar.

[Watch with sound (MP4, 14 s)](media/plan-progress.mp4)

- One thin row per task: state, title, pixel bar, percent, close button
- A pill on the bar shows the current stage and step count; hover it to see how long the plan has run
- Stage boundaries are capsules, steps are dots; hover a checkpoint to see when it was reached
- A finished bar turns green and its pill shows a check and the time the task took, then leaves on its own a minute later; a failed bar stays until closed
- Four states in one brightness, white text readable on each: running (violet), needs input (amber), error (red), done (green)
- Subagents appear as strips under the task that started them: name, model and effort (`haiku 4.5`, `sonnet 5.5 · medium`), the tool in use, a live clock; a status change morphs in 200 ms and finished strips fold after 5 seconds. A waiting or failed agent keeps its strip; the others share one summary row until the ▾ button opens them out
- The plan can be rewritten mid-run: resent stages keep finished steps by title, and the percent follows
- Bars survive closing the app: each session's bars are saved and come back when the session is resumed
- Soft sounds only when you are needed: the main task needs a decision, hits an error or finishes, or a permission dialog put to you has gone unanswered (the engine's own notice, 6 s on the desktop). Subagents finishing or failing stay quiet, and an approval the mode, a hook or the main agent settles never sounds
- A small bundled skill documents the tool for Claude, loaded only when needed

### Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add zycck/claude-mods
/plugin install plan-progress@zycck-mods
```

Or copy `plugins/plan-progress` into `~/.claude/skills/plan-progress` to load it in every session.

### Commands

- `/progress` toggles the bars
- `/progress-demo` plays a short demo: two tasks with their agents, a question, an error, a rewritten plan
- `/progress-sounds` plays the three sounds
- `/progress-clear` removes all bars

### How it works

The mod registers a `plan_progress` tool. Claude creates a bar once with the full breakdown, then sends short updates such as `{id, next: true}` or `{id, done: ["Routes"]}`; a step name the bar does not have is refused with the list of its steps. Agent strips come from engine events alone and cost no tokens. Updates cost a few dozen tokens and the rules sit in the tool's cached description. A light gate asks Claude to create a bar before a task with several edits, and reminds it when a bar goes stale.

The track is drawn as a still image and the hover parts sit in a see-through layer on top, so agent updates redraw only their own strip and nothing flickers.

Built with Claude Code mods (function hooks). The bar looks best in the desktop app; the terminal gets a text bar.

### Tests

`plugins/plan-progress/tests` drives the real module through its hooks with a stub engine: `node compile.cjs ../hooks/register.tsx register.mjs`, then `node regress.mjs` and `node scenarios.mjs`. See its README.
